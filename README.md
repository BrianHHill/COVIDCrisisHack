# COVIDCrisisHack

As COVID-19 starts to gain traction and deliver epidemiological impact globally, there is an ongoing need to marshall resources and develop tactical responses to the impact points of this global pandemic. 

Originating from the event hosts 2020 eLife Sciences open-leadership program and mentor discussions, the COVIDCrisisHack is a virtual hackathon for online communities to gather around and lean-into to help develop tech-augmented responses to the unfolding crisis.

# About the Event
We're in event concept development mode at the moment, engaging with groups like Medical Engineering and Innovation schools, LifeSciences programs and event production peers to help shape the event for you to participate in shortly.

# About the Host
An experienced hackathon host (https://www.laughingmind.com/events.html), Brian is also a health professional and innovator, who's been involved in the 2019-2020 Australian Bushfire responses, developing and co-producing citizen centric responses to the disaster, supporting the development of related initiatives such as https://crisis.app and https://ausfirehack.info This event was initiated during progression of a related initiative at https://github.com/BrianHHill/eResilience

# What we need
We're keeping our eyes and ears peeled for emergent issues that online community members are experiencing in their towns, cities and neighbourhoods that an event like this can help deliver impact for. We'd ask you to keep posting into our Issues register at https://github.com/BrianHHill/COVIDCrisisHack/issues for us to curate in the event planning phase. 

We're also looking for experienced individuals to assist in the co-production of this online initiative, particularly if they've been involved in delivering distributed online challenges at scale. We're mindful of the need for localisation of initiatives as satellite events, or co-produced event streams

Sponsors and enablers are also welcomed, as goodwill and volunteer spirit only gets you so far. If you fit this latter category, reach out to me directly at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaughingmind/
